	AIM: To solve the question below

=======================================================================================================
Someone hands you a deck of cards which you thoroughly shuffle. 
Next, you start to deal them, face-up, counting the cards as you go. 'One, Two, Three â€¦'
The aim is to predict what the count will be when you encounter the second black Ace in the deck.

If you had to select one position before you started to deal, what number would you select that maximizes 
your chance of guessing the location of the second black Ace?

Simulate the situation: Done in simulate.py << Might contain hard coded parts-- Ignore>>

Use theoretic calculation: Done in theoretic.py << Ignore>>

Final comparison: compare.py <<---FINAL PROGRAM--->>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Conclusion:

The theoretic and simulated cases agree with one other
